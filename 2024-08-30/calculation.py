# Output: (-0.9999999999999999+1.2246467991473532e-16j) # This is approximately equal to -1
# The output is not exactly -1 due to floating-point arithmetic errors.
# The imaginary part is very close to zero, indicating that the result is almost real.
# The small imaginary part is due to the precision limitations of floating-point arithmetic.
